Python code, and Jupyter notebooks, that run Dedalus to find the dispersion spectrum (eigenvalue problem = EVP) 
and time evolution (initial value problem = IVP) for waves in the linearized rotating shallow water equations (SWEs). 

Instructions for installing Dedalus can be found at URL https://dedalus-project.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/installation.html

The .gif files shows the time-evolution of an equatorial Kelvin wave on this "planet with two equators" (required by the periodic boundary conditions in both directions).
